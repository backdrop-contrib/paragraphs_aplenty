# Paragraphs Aplenty

This module, when enabled, installs several Paragraph types:

* Hero with callout
* Graphic list of media blocks
* Cards
* Grid / row of columns with ability to stretch a block.
* Accordions
* Heading with anchor
* Image

After installation, feel free to alter the Paragraph types by adding fields,
and altering fields. You can also customize templates by copying them from the
module and placing in your theme. However, try not to remove the default fields.
